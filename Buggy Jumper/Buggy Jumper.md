# Buggy Jumper 
After decompiling the APK with JADX , I found a file named flag.gdc

I cant read it . So, i decompiled the apk with another tool called Godot 

```java
extends Node


func flag_c2d5a0c9cae9857a3cfa662cd2869835_():
	var flag = "replace the underscores in the function name with curly braces when submitting!"
```
